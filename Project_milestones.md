##Original Prompt##
now we need to make this agentic, first - take the query results from the user, evaluate them, sort by relevance and put the newest stuff up top.

Then an agent will quickly summarize each paper and drop it into a grid of the top 10 most relevant

Then we need an agent to evaluate the results and tell the user what it thinks and why. Include recommendations for changing the queries, constantly trying to get closer and closer to what the user is really asking.

# Project Milestones

## Completed

1. **Connected to GitHub Repository**
   - Cloned the repository [https://github.com/ChrisWhiteSr/expert-researcher](https://github.com/ChrisWhiteSr/expert-researcher) into the project directory.

2. **Initial Setup**
   - Created `index.html` with the basic structure and initial search functionality.
   - Pushed `index.html` to the GitHub repository.

3. **Implemented Sorting and Summarization**
   - Updated `index.html` to sort search results by relevance (`citationCount`) and publication year, placing the newest and most cited papers at the top.
   - Limited displayed results to the top 10 most relevant papers.
   - Integrated OpenAI's GPT API to generate concise summaries for each paper's abstract.

4. **Evaluation and Recommendations**
   - Added an evaluation section to analyze search results.
   - Provided feedback and recommendations to refine search queries for better relevance.

5. **Attempted Secure Summarization API Integration**
   - Attempted to set up a backend MCP server named `summarization-server` to handle summarization requests securely.
   - The operation was denied.

6. **Enhanced Summarization Features**
   - Implemented a keyword-based sentence ranking mechanism for summarizing abstracts on the client side.
   - Replaced the simple truncation method with a more context-aware summarization approach.

7. **Full Evaluation Agent Implementation**
   - Enhanced the `evaluateResults` function to include detailed analysis:
     - **Field Distribution:** Calculated and displayed the distribution of papers across different fields of study.
     - **Publication Trends:** Analyzed and presented the distribution of publication years to identify trends over time.
     - **Top Cited Papers:** Identified and highlighted the most cited papers to showcase influential research.
     - **Keyword Analysis:** Assessed the frequency of specific keywords within the abstracts to gauge topic focus.
   - Improved recommendations based on the analysis, providing specific suggestions for query refinement and diversity enhancement.
   - Enhanced the evaluation feedback presentation using Tailwind CSS for better readability and user engagement.

8. **Current Challenges and Progress**
   - **OpenAI Integration Issues:**
     - Initially encountered dependency conflicts with newer versions of OpenAI API (v1.12.0)
     - Resolved by downgrading to OpenAI v0.28.1 for better stability
     - Updated server code to use compatible API format
   - **Environment Setup:**
     - Added proper requirements.txt for dependency management
     - Configured .replit for automated package installation
     - Implemented detailed logging for better debugging
   - **API Security:**
     - Implemented secure handling of OpenAI API key through environment variables
     - Added CORS headers for secure cross-origin requests
     - Enhanced error handling and user feedback

## Planned

1. **User Interface Enhancements**
   - Improve the UI for a better user experience, including dynamic updates and an improved layout to accommodate summaries and evaluation feedback.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize the application's performance for faster response times and more efficient API usage.

3. **Stability Improvements**
   - Monitor and resolve any remaining API integration issues
   - Implement better error recovery mechanisms
   - Add comprehensive error messaging for users

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Implement systematic testing of the query suggestion feature
   - Validate API responses and error handling
   - Test across different query types and scenarios
